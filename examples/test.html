                                        hangs up the phone,
                                        confused.<br>C: ANSEN<br>D: What did they say?<br>C: ASSISTANT<br>D: They said
                                        we should look out the
                                        window. Ansen steps to the window and looks out: In the courtyard below, coeds
                                        are scrambling to get out of
                                        the way as a military helicopter sets down in the middle of the quad and dozens
                                        of ARMED FEDERAL AGENTS
                                        converge on his building.<br><br></p>

                                        alone, on one side of a
                                        conference table. The other side is filled with GOVERNMENT MEN -- NSA mostly,
                                        some DIA. The door opens and
                                        his assistant steps in. Armed guards pat him down, then shove him into a
                                        seat.<br>C: ANSEN<br>D: Is that
                                        really necessary? One of the NSA agents leans forward.<br>C: NSA AGENT<br>D:
                                        You've been complaining for
                                        years that the government doesn't take your project seriously enough, Doctor.
                                        You can't have it both ways.
                                        Ansen motions to his assistant, who turns on a projector. On-screen, we see the
                                        familiar pulse and
                                        echoes.<br>E: smiles<br>C: ANSEN<br>D: Yesterday morning, our facility in
                                        Hanford identified this signal: a
                                        neutron star colliding with a supermassive black hole. We went through the last
                                        year's data and triangulated
                                        the source. The pulse is translated into a crude animatic of a neutron star
                                        circling into the black
                                        hole.<br>C: NSA AGENT<br>D: We know that, Doctor. What we don't know is why,
                                        according to your numbers, this
                                        event took place right here in our own solar system. Suddenly, the image
                                        overlays the sun, the earth, and
                                        the rest of our solar system around the black hole.<br>C: ANSEN<br>D: It didn't.
                                        Because if it had we'd all
                                        be dead by now. On-screen, Jupiter, then the Earth and the inner planets are
                                        consumed by the black hole.
                                        Only the sun survives, pulled into orbit around its new master.<br>C:

                                        the black hole system is
                                        removed to a distant corner, connected to ours by a tunnel through space-time. A

                                        read your book, Doctor. You
                                        said that wormholes are impossible.<br>C: ANSEN<br>D: There is nothing quite as
                                        satisfying as being proved
                                        utterly wrong. I said that a wormhole couldn't exist naturally. Not for more
                                        than a few billionths of a

                                        ASSISTANT<br>D: We don't have any way to
                                        answer that question.<br>C: NSA AGENT<br>D: You're not under peer review here,
                                        Doctor. I don't care about
                                        your reputation. I need to know how that thing got there. Now. Ansen finally
                                        speaks up.<br>E: ignores

                                        Whoever they are, if they can build a wormhole, they could erase us in the blink
                                        of an eye. Luckily, that
                                        also means we have nothing they could be interested in.<br>E: smiles<br>C: NSA

                                        species. The assistant, embarrassed, looks down.<br>N: The agent notices.<br>C:

                                        agree?<br>C: ASSISTANT<br>D: No. I don't think we can assume an alien
                                        intelligence built the wormhole. But
                                        the opportunity it represents is incredible. We could explore parts of the

                                        times before. Down on the

                                        eating his breakfast. Donald is
                                        on the porch, looking at a black clouds of smoke in the distance. The

                                        I... I think the patch kit might not be there... Because I was using it for my

                                        what can go wrong will go
                                        wrong. Murph, looking hurt, walks off.<br>E: CONT'D<br>N: Cooper turns to his
                                        son.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Find
                                        something to patch it with.<br>C: TOM<br>D: How am I supposed to do that?<br>C:
                                        COOPER<br>D: Figure it out.
                                        I'm not always going to be here to help you. Cooper leaves Tom to catch up with

                                        Murph, dad?<br>C: COOPER<br>D:
                                        Listen to me. Murph's law doesn't mean that. It means what can happen will
                                        happen. All kinds of things. Good
                                        or bad. And that's the way you want it to be. Why?<br>C: MURPH COOPER<br>D:
                                        Because if nothing ever happened
                                        to you then you wouldn't learn anything. Murph is staring off into the distance.
                                        Murph?<br>N: He's heard
                                        something.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Then Cooper hears it, too. A LOW RUMBLING SOUND.
                                        Cooper looks out over the
                                        river. Then he turns back and tackles his son to the ground. Suddenly, a MASSIVE
                                        AIRPLANE SOARS overhead, so
                                        close they can almost touch it. It bounces the truck on its suspension, then
                                        soars off over the fields
                                        behind them. Cooper grabs Murph and races back to the truck. He pulls a laptop
                                        and an antenna made out of a
                                        Pringles can out of the back of the truck. He hands the laptop and antenna to

                                        but no cockpit. The wings are covered in black solar cells.<br><br></p>

                                        Chinese military drone. Solar
                                        cells could power an entire farm. Take the wheel. Cooper hands Murph the

                                        Tom<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Keep it pointed right at it, OK? Murph nods. Tom takes
                                        the wheel as his dad works the
                                        laptop, trying to communicate with the huge Russian drone. The screen fills with

                                        They round a corner and come face-to-face with a robot harvester. Tom jerks the

                                        Ahead, the trail disappears as the edge of the hills falls away -- it's a three
                                        hundred-foot drop. Tom locks

                                        looks at his dad, wide-eyed. He takes the laptop and moves his fingers gingerly
                                        across the pad. In response,
                                        the massive plane banks into a tight turn in the valley below. For a moment,
                                        Murph is in pure heaven,
                                        sending the drone dancing through the valley below.<br>E: CONT'D<br>C:

                                        valley -- there, next to the river. Murph leads the plane in a figure eight and
                                        then begins guiding it into
                                        a gentle landing in the valley floor below. EXT. ABANDONED GOLF COURSE, VALLEY
                                        FLOOR -- DAY The truck limps
                                        along the overgrown fairway of a long-defunct golf course towards the massive
                                        hulk of the Russian drone,
                                        Cooper and the boys climb down. The valley is silent save for the truck's engine
                                        WHEEZING and SPUTTERING as
                                        it cools. Cooper runs a hand over the smooth carbon flank of the drone.<br>E:
                                        CONT'D<br>C: TOM<br>D: How
                                        long do you think it's been up there, Dad?<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Chinese mission
                                        control went down same as us,
                                        twenty years ago. It's been up there ever since.<br>C: TOM<br>D: What was it
                                        doing flying so low? Cooper
                                        reads the information pouring into his laptop.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: It was looking
                                        for something. Intercepted
                                        some kind of signal. It's been at eighty thousand feet. Sun probably cooked its
                                        brain. Cooper runs his hand
                                        along the flank till he finds an access patch. He pulls out a crowbar and pries
                                        open the hatch. Inside,
                                        surrounded by a nest of liquid cooling tubes, is a small black module -- the
                                        drone's auto-pilot. Cooper
                                        looks down at Murph, who is standing at his elbow.<br>E: shrugs<br>C:
                                        MURPH<br>D: What are you going to do
                                        with it?<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Reprogram it. Give it something socially responsible
                                        to do like drive a combine
                                        or a tractor.<br>C: MURPH<br>D: Couldn't we just let it go? not hurting anyone.
                                        Cooper looks down at his
                                        son.<br>E: quiet<br>N: It's Good kid.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: We need all the help we
                                        can get, Murph. This thing
                                        has to adapt, just like the rest of us. Cooper gently pries the control module
                                        out. EXT. COUNTY SCHOOL --

                                        exactly who's driving the pickup
                                        truck with half of a Russian spy plane hanging out of the bed as it pulls up.

                                        COUNTY SCHOOL -- DAY Cooper is ushered into the office. The PRINCIPAL, 40s, an
                                        efficient-looking man, shakes
                                        his hand.<br>C: PRINCIPAL<br>D: Good to see you, Mr. Cooper. This is Ms. Kelly,
                                        Murph's teacher. Cooper
                                        smiles at Ms. KELLY, 30s, attractive.<br>C: PRINCIPAL<br>D: So we've gotten
                                        Tom's score back.
                                        Congratulations. He's going to make an excellent farmer. The principal slides a
                                        carbon copy across the desk
                                        to Cooper, who looks taken aback.<br>E: CONT'D<br>C: COOPER<br>D: What about
                                        college?<br>C: PRINCIPAL<br>D:
                                        The University of California only accepts a few hundred students a year, Mr.
                                        Cooper. You have to be
                                        realistic.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: You're ruling out college for him now? He's only
                                        fifteen.<br>C:
                                        PRINCIPAL<br>D: I'm sorry. I'm afraid Tom's score simply isn't high
                                        enough.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: What are you,
                                        about a 36-inch waist? 30-inch inseam?<br>E: beat<br>C: PRINCIPAL<br>D: I'm not

                                        telling me you need two numbers to measure your own ass, but just one to measure
                                        my son's future? Ms. Kelly
                                        stifles a laugh, then, with a look from the principal, takes on the appropriate
                                        look of offense.<br>C:
                                        PRINCIPAL<br>D: I understand you're a well-educated man, Mr. Cooper. A
                                        scientist? Engineer.<br>C: COOPER
                                        PRINCIPAL<br>D: Frankly, the world doesn't need any more engineers. We didn't
                                        run out of trains or
                                        television sets or satellites. We ran out of food.<br>E: beat<br>C:
                                        PRINCIPAL<br>D: The world needs farmers,
                                        Mr. Cooper. And I'm sure your son Tom is going to make a fine one. We're a
                                        caretaker generation. But things
                                        are getting better. Maybe your grandchildren will be able to attend college.
                                        Cooper looks down, swallowing
                                        his anger. Are we done?<br>E: CONT'D smiles benignly<br>C: COOPER
                                        PRINCIPAL<br>D: One more thing. Ms. Kelly
                                        here says that Murph brought a book to school about the lunar landings. He
                                        slides an old textbook with a
                                        picture of a rocket on the cover across the desk to Cooper.<br>C: COOPER<br>D:
                                        One of my old textbooks. the
                                        pictures.<br>N: Murph liked<br>C: MS. KELLY<br>D: This is one of the old federal
                                        textbooks. We've replaced
                                        them with corrected versions. Corrected?<br>C: COOPER MS. KELLY<br>D: The new
                                        textbooks explain that the
                                        Apollo lunar missions were faked in order to bankrupt the Soviet Union.<br>C:
                                        COOPER<br>D: You don't believe
                                        we went to the moon?<br>C: MS. KELLY<br>D: I believe it was a brilliant piece of
                                        propaganda. The Soviets
                                        spent years trying to build rockets and other useless machines.<br>C:
                                        COOPER<br>D: "Useless machines"?<br>C:
                                        MS. KELLY<br>D: Yes, Mr. Cooper. The kind of wastefulness and excess that the
                                        20th century represented. Your
                                        children would be better off learning about this planet, rather than reading
                                        fantasies about leaving it.
                                        Cooper is silent for a long moment.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: One of those useless
                                        machines they used to make was
                                        called an MRI. If we had any of them left the doctors might have been able to
                                        find the cyst in my wife's
                                        brain before she died, rather than afterwards. And then my kids could have been
                                        raised by two parents,
                                        instead of me and their pain-in-the-ass grandfather. Ms. Kelly's face falls,
                                        ashen. Most of it,
                                        anyway.<br>N: Cooper swallows his anger.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: You ever consider
                                        the best thing for the world
                                        and humanity might have been for us to part company? Cooper gets up to leave.

                                        its way up the dunes, trying
                                        to reach the beach, its wheels struggling for traction in the soft sand. A MAN

                                        it circles overhead. Cooper lands the plane on a deserted roadway. Jumps down.
                                        He intercepts one of the

                                        checks the fault code and resets
                                        the computer. The man jogs over to meet him.<br>C: RIGGS<br>D: Thanks for coming

                                        out towards the yard. Cooper
                                        follows his stare.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: I told you, Murph. There's no one to take
                                        it back to.<br>E:

                                        can salvage? Cooper thinks
                                        it over.<br>N: Murph scrambles to get his shoes.<br><br></p>

                                        Cooper walks over to the well,
                                        putting in a pair of earplugs. A line is staked off, leading down into the well
                                        below. Cooper begins hauling
                                        the line up. As the probe breaks the surface of the water, the SHRIEK returns to
                                        its normal volume. Cooper
                                        rolls the probe out onto the ground.<br><br></p>

                                        through a glade. He stops to get
                                        his bearings. Leans against a tree. Snatches his hand back -- the trunk of the
                                        tree is red hot. Cooper steps
                                        back -- it's not a tree at all, but a camouflaged chimney stack. He looks up:
                                        the tree is venting steam.
                                        Cooper walks a little further, until he finds several massive tanks. The tanks
                                        are filling with a bubbling
                                        liquid -- some kind of industrial process is taking place beneath him. Cooper
                                        finally catches up with Murph
                                        at the edge of a clearing.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Careful. There's some kind of

                                        still... alive?<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Can't be. It's a marine. Haven't made them
                                        for thirty years. I've never
                                        seen one intact before. Cooper steps closer to the robot, which is frozen. Its
                                        alloy frame heavily tarnished
                                        and weather-beaten. It looks like it might have been standing here for
                                        decades.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: I think
                                        we need to go, Murph.<br>E: CONT'D<br>C: MURPH<br>D: But can't we take it back?
                                        You could fix it up, get him
                                        to do chores.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: No. I don't know what this place is, but we're
                                        leaving. Murph, ignoring his
                                        father, steps forward to touch the robot. Suddenly, the robot SPRINGS into
                                        action, picking up the boy and
                                        hoisting him up to eye level. Cooper, stunned, points the rifle at the robot.
                                        The robot turns, dropping the
                                        boy, RIPS the rifle from Cooper's hands, BENDS it, then SLAMS him up against the
                                        side of the water tank.
                                        Cooper punches him, then winces in agony. Murph picks up the rifle and begins
                                        HITTING the robot as hard as
                                        he can. The robot opens his mouth and addresses Cooper calmly in the clipped
                                        tones of a US marine.<br>C:

                                        that far off the mark.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: Get back in your little plane, go back
                                        to your farming commune. And

                                        past Cooper to the plane. He
                                        sees the probe. Tries to open the door. It's locked.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Wait a

                                        two panels open in the ground, revealing a huge, reinforced service elevator.

                                        ten story tall rocket. Dozens of ROBOTS are working on in, maintaining it.
                                        Cooper, stunned, looks at
                                        Brand.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Who are you people?<br>C: BRAND<br>D: The government
                                        gave us plenty of practice
                                        looking for our own funding. Keep moving. Tars carries the probe over to an area
                                        of the hangar filled with
                                        electronic equipment. A group of ENGINEERS and ROBOTS converge around Tars. An
                                        OLDER ENGINEER looks familiar
                                        -- 70s, white-haired, this is Ansen's assistant at Caltech who we met fifty

                                        like six. Maybe seven. I can't
                                        tell from the radiation damage. The older engineer looks at the probe,
                                        astonished.<br>E: CONT'D<br>C: OLD

                                        must have been looking for Canaveral. Tars bolts the probe down into a purpose
                                        built rig. DOYLE, 40s, an
                                        engineer, begins hooking leads into the probe.<br>E: thinking it over<br>C:
                                        COOPER<br>D: Canaveral's been

                                        frustrated.<br>C: DOYLE<br>D:
                                        It's not responding to the handshake. I can't open anything on primary. Brand
                                        looks up at Cooper.<br>C:
                                        BRAND<br>D: What did you do to it? Nothing.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: I got something
                                        off of it.<br>N: Cooper looks
                                        around. There's a safety station on the wall with a battery powered
                                        defibrillator.<br>C: COOPER<br>E: CONT'D
                                        to Brand<br>C: May I?<br>D: Brand nods, wary. Cooper walks over to the wall,
                                        takes the defibrillator, and
                                        hooks it up to the probe. He taps into the current and runs a lead into the
                                        terminal. Brand's Father
                                        watches, fascinated, as Cooper fires the defibrillator.<br>C: OLD ENGINEER<br>D:
                                        Of course. The high voltage
                                        allows you to image the entire memory unit at once. Information begins appearing
                                        on the terminal's

                                        monitor starts pulling good data off of the probe. The older man and Doyle begin
                                        sorting through it. Cooper
                                        smiles at Brand, who seems less than impressed. The footage of the ice-covered
                                        planet Cooper saw earlier
                                        pops onto the screen. The engineers and physicists get very quiet, studying the
                                        images.<br>C: DOYLE<br>D: It
                                        found something. Very thin nitrogen-based atmosphere. Trace radiation. Surface

                                        will fail.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: Now how could you possibly know that?<br>C:

                                        abandoned machine shop, surrounded by the massive remains of rocket engines in
                                        various states of disrepair.
                                        Tars is blocking the door. Cooper stands. Tars wags a long, hydraulic finger at

                                        with a group of older ROBOTS
                                        who are overhauling an engine. One problem -- the engine isn't there. Their
                                        programming hasn't been updated
                                        to reflect their obsolescence. Murph watches, entranced, as the robots go about

                                        lab that Brand and the older engineer are arguing about something. She finally
                                        relents and walks towards the

                                        return the gesture. Instead, she
                                        holds up the telemetry board.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: You don't like this one, you get

                                        notices.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: We didn't know what kind of gravity to expect. We

                                        planets. The component pieces

                                        help us. The same way we
                                        used to try to help animals when they were threatened with extinction.<br>E:

                                        assuming that whoever built
                                        the wormhole has a better plan than we did. If I'm wrong, we'll die, same as

                                        we're guessing, then I'd say Brand's right. The wormhole couldn't exist
                                        naturally. I think it's there for a
                                        reason. That someone is trying to help us. Brand looks satisfied.<br>C:

                                        probably be killed. I said I thought there was a plan. Not that the plan was for
                                        us to find a planet like
                                        Earth to save a handful of people. Birds don't learn to fly just so that they

                                        supposed to be doing out there?<br>C: ROTH<br>D: To keep moving. Seeking.

                                        watches him for a moment. Tars looks up.<br>C: TARS<br>D: It's the comms relay.
                                        It will allow us to talk to

                                        are you painting it?<br>N:
                                        Tars looks almost bashful.<br>C: TARS<br>D: It helps me calibrate my fine motor

                                        Sure it does. You're pretty good. Tars double checks his work.<br>E:

                                        during the war.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: What'd you paint? Tombstones.<br>C:
                                        TARS<br>D: Cooper watches him finish
                                        in silence. INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE Cooper watches a
                                        highly-compressed video of his son, Tom,
                                        talking about school.<br>C: TOM<br>D: They said I can start an agriculture class
                                        a year early. Cooper shakes
                                        his head.<br>C: TOM<br>D: I've got to go, Dad. Hope you're safe up there.<br>E:

                                        I'm sorry, Coop. I asked Murph to record you a message but he's still... well,
                                        he's still angry with you.
                                        I'll try again next week. The video cuts out.<br>N: Cooper stares at the

                                    <p id=57>Scene 57: INT. ENGINE ROOM, ENDURANCE<br>N: Cooper, Brand and Tars are
                                        moving the bundles of
                                        colonization equipment into bins along the wall of the craft. Tars pulls a stack
                                        of equipment out the stack
                                        and stows it against the wall. Cooper copies the procedure. They labor in
                                        silence, working their way along
                                        the hull. Cooper gets quicker with each bundle, keeping pace with Tars.<br>C:
                                        TARS<br>D: Be careful. It's
                                        difficult to gauge mass in zero gravity.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: How much do these
                                        things weigh? Four tons.<br>C:
                                        TARS<br>D: Cooper looks at the incredibly heavy bundle spinning easily in his
                                        hands. He tries to stop it.
                                        Catches his hand. Damn.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: He jerks his hand away, then pushes
                                        himself after the spinning
                                        bundle, trying to stop it before it can damage the hull. Tars helps him catch it
                                        inches from the hull wall.
                                        Brand floats over to Cooper, smiling at him the whole time with an exaggerated
                                        grin. Smile.<br>C:
                                        BRAND<br>D: Cooper smiles, taken aback by Brand's sudden friendliness.
                                        Why?<br>C: COOPER BRAND<br>D: Because
                                        it lowers your blood pressure.<br><br></p>

                                        over his hand, sewing the meat of it back together with perfect little

                                        you feeling? Fine.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: The anesthetic is working.<br>C:
                                        CASE<br>D: No -- I mean how is your
                                        mood? You seem to be developing good relations with everyone on the mission.
                                        Except perhaps Ms. Brand.<br>C:
                                        COOPER<br>D: You worry about my hand and I'll worry about my mood.<br>E:
                                        embarrassed<br>C: CASE<br>D: Only
                                        five percent of my resources are devoted to human anatomy. Ten percent is the
                                        mission protocol. The rest is
                                        human psychology. Why?<br>C: COOPER CASE<br>D: We are floating in a total vacuum
                                        in a plastic ship powered
                                        by nuclear engines. But the most dangerous thing onboard is the three pounds of
                                        organic material in your
                                        skull.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: If we're such a liability, why take us along? You and
                                        Tars could build the colony
                                        without us. You wouldn't need to bring food or oxygen.<br>C: CASE<br>D: Because
                                        humans, despite your obvious
                                        physical shortcomings, are better at surviving than we are. Your programming is
                                        better than ours.<br>C:
                                        COOPER<br>D: Humans aren't programmed. Case stops, looking Cooper in the

                                        prefer I was honest? These things can be uncomfortable for humans.<br>C:
                                        COOPER<br>D: Did they program you
                                        to be condescending?<br>C: CASE<br>D: Of course. But you're not supposed to

                                        Case finishes the stitches. Ties off the end.<br>C: CASE<br>D: Humans are good
                                        at surviving because
                                        evolution gave you magical thinking -the idea that your relationships mean
                                        something. You can't explain the
                                        feelings, so you think of them as irrational. But they're not. They're
                                        programming.<br>E: CONT'D<br>C:

                                        so much you won't listen to me.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: How would that make us better
                                        at surviving?<br>C:
                                        CASE<br>D: When I die, the last thing I will see will be a diagnostic of my own
                                        power cycle. Would you like
                                        to know the last thing you will see? Cooper hesitates.<br>N: Case senses the
                                        jump in his heart rate.<br>C:
                                        CASE<br>D: This conversation is making you uncomfortable. We should stop.<br>E:

                                        want to know.<br>C: CASE<br>D: The last thing you will see before you die will
                                        be your children. Your mind
                                        does this to you to get you to fight a little harder to survive, to try to
                                        return to them, even if death is
                                        certain. Cooper looks away, overcome for a second with emotion. Case watches
                                        him, gauging his mood, whether
                                        he has said too much. INT. COMMUNICATIONS ROOM, ENDURANCE Cooper begins
                                        recording a message.<br>E:
                                        beat<br>N: He looks unsure.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: We've almost reached the
                                        wormhole. Just in case anything
                                        happens, I just wanted to say... I love you boys. And I hope whatever your lives
                                        become, whatever is coming
                                        your way... you make the most of it. Cooper stops recording. Looks at the
                                        equipment, thinking it over.
                                        Erases the message. Stands to leave. As he steps to the door he notices Brand
                                        watching him through the
                                        window. She looks away. INT. OBSERVATION DECK, ENDURANCE Cooper steps out.<br>E:

                                        up at him.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: We'll be able to communicate with Earth even from
                                        the far side of the wormhole.
                                        Cooper smiles, grateful for this small kindness. I know.<br>C: COOPER<br>D:
                                        Thank you.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: I
                                        can't imagine how tough it would be to leave your kids behind.<br>C:
                                        COOPER<br>D: You never had any? I
                                        thought I was a pariah for only having two.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: Hard to settle
                                        down when you've spent your
                                        life waiting to leave the planet. Cooper looks at the holographic model of the
                                        black hole system. The ice
                                        planet looks precariously balanced, orbiting the smaller black hole.<br>C:
                                        COOPER<br>D: Strange place to

                                        surface of the sun, either.
                                        Black holes are a more stable supply of power than stars in many ways.<br>C:
                                        COOPER<br>D: You really think

                                        think we're on our own. Cooper looks at the impossibly complicated system of
                                        black holes orbiting each

                                        again, trapping the wormhole inside it. With a GRUMBLE, the ship begins
                                        contracting, squeezing itself down
                                        around the wormhole mouth. Cooper takes a deep breath as the center of the ship

                                        slides gently, silently, through the wormhole. The quiet is eery. Suddenly, a
                                        point of distortion appears in
                                        the hull next to Cooper. It looks like someone is pushing against the hull of
                                        the ship with a giant
                                        finger.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Something's happening to the hull over here.<br>C:

                                        along the hull, Doyle speaks up,
                                        panicked.<br>C: DOYLE<br>D: I've got a problem over here, too. Doyle is watching
                                        a separate distortion move
                                        across the inner wall of the ship. This one seems to be TWISTING the material of
                                        the hull. Suddenly, the
                                        point in front of Cooper detaches itself from the outer wall and moves through
                                        the space in front of him,
                                        bending the empty space itself, distorting the ship behind it like a
                                        sphere-shaped magnifying glass.<br>C:

                                        It's getting bigger. Doyle puts up his hand to defend himself. The sphere
                                        absorbs it, twisting Doyle's hand.
                                        Doyle CRIES OUT. His hand is twisted completely around, impossibly mangled. But
                                        Doyle, hyperventilating,

                                        distorting his body.<br>C:
                                        BRAND<br>D: This isn't turbulence. Look at the way they're moving -- it's like

                                        Cooper watches the sphere distort his arm, running along the length of it.<br>C:
                                        COOPER<br>D: Can you ask it
                                        to stop? Suddenly, as quickly as they appeared, the distortions vanish. For a
                                        moment, the crew is silent,
                                        still spellbound by the encounter. An ALARM sounds. Suddenly, the inner chamber
                                        begins to distort from a
                                        spherical shape to bispherical: two spheres joined. The ship GROANS as if it's
                                        being pulled apart.<br>C:
                                        ROTH<br>D: The wormhole is splitting into two paths. Radiation is pouring from
                                        one path to the other.<br>C:
                                        CASE<br>D: Release the second mouth.<br>C: DOYLE<br>D: None of our testing
                                        involved opening the ship inside
                                        the wormhole. We have no idea what might happen.<br>C: CASE<br>D: We're going to
                                        find out. Doyle reaches
                                        over to an auxiliary panel and punches in a sequence. After a moment, the hull
                                        cracks open, creating a
                                        channel through which the radiating mouth can escape. The opening in the ship
                                        allows the pressure to begin
                                        to concentrate on one fracture point. The ship SHUDDERS as it's squeezed along
                                        its axis. Case punches in a
                                        code and the ship begins to close again, painstakingly slowly. Finally, the ship
                                        calms as it closes around
                                        the original wormhole.<br>C: CASE<br>D: We're reaching the far end of the

                                        mouth begins to grow inside the inner chamber. What was a ball of light spreads
                                        out into a black canvas
                                        studded with points of light -- like looking into the universe through the wrong
                                        end of a telescope. Cooper
                                        presses himself against the wall and holds on as the hull beneath him opens

                                        until it becomes a blur.
                                        The ship begins to GROAN as it appears to be pulled in two different directions.
                                        The ship is now speeding
                                        around the black hole at incredible speed -- one revolution every four seconds.

                                        receives a long garbled update.
                                        Then it shuts down. Cooper drags himself along the hull until he reaches the

                                        the nebula, the surroundings are a little brighter than a full moon on Earth.

                                        at. They are standing on a sea of ice, which spreads for miles. In the distance,
                                        small rock formations break
                                        through the ice. Brand takes a surface reading of the ice.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: The

                                        walks fifty yards, then stops on a gentle slope that leads down into a small

                                        hillside. Cooper is drawn to a small mound in the middle of the valley, four
                                        feet high. He takes out a small
                                        folding shovel and begins scraping at the ice and snow. Case hits something
                                        solid. But it's not a probe. He
                                        digs around a little more, then reaches up and hacks away at the hillside,
                                        revealing the outline of

                                        unsure what to make of it. A few feet away, Cooper cuts enough of the mound away
                                        to reveal something
                                        flexible -- fabric caked with ice. He scrapes away the snow, revealing a bright
                                        patch of red fabric: It's

                                        to follow Case down into the ice. Cooper looks at Doyle, then follows

                                        casts it aside and begins SMASHING at the ice with his bare hand. Brand is
                                        looking at the walls of the ice

                                        Brand, ever the scientist, forgets their predicament and begins chipping at the

                                        shines her flashlight over the ice again, but nothing happens. Roth takes the
                                        depth meter dangling by a

                                        light he can see is from Case, falling calmly a few yards beneath him. As they
                                        fall, the light from the
                                        microbes trapped in the ice above sweeps across the inside of the cavern,
                                        illuminating the floor of the
                                        massive cavern thousands of feet down. The rock formations they saw on the
                                        surface are actually the tip of a
                                        mountain range extending into the distance, disappearing into the ice above as
                                        if it were cloud cover. The
                                        base of the mountains is covered in a thick jungle-like foliage that runs into a

                                        On the far side of the sea, another mountain range stretches into the distance,

                                        the ice. We're down to three suits. We'll have to send someone ahead to get a

                                        need one.<br>D: Why not?<br>C: DOYLE BRAND<br>D: Because I'm not going anywhere.
                                        This is our new home. Brand
                                        picks up some of her instruments and a sample case and hikes into the jungle.

                                        samples. If you find her,
                                        tell her to head back. Night should be falling soon.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: What
                                        happens then?<br>C: ROTH<br>D:
                                        Your guess is as good as mine. Cooper hikes into the jungle to look for Brand.
                                        EXT. JUNGLE, ICE PLANET --
                                        DAY Cooper finds Brand taking samples from the tree-like lifeforms, which are
                                        wildly different from their
                                        counterparts back on Earth, piled in torturous coils, as if frozen in a struggle
                                        to punch through the canopy
                                        to reach the light above.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: This is incredible. The organisms
                                        trapped in the ice above
                                        absorb xrays and emit light. In return, these plants absorb the light and emit
                                        oxygen, which feeds the
                                        animals trapped in the ice. Brand cuts off a sample and drops it into the case.
                                        The transparent wall of the
                                        case magnifies the structure onto the glass automatically. She compares it with
                                        the flecks she collected in
                                        the ice above, fascinated.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: Look at this. I think they're the
                                        same organism at a different
                                        stage of the life cycle. It's fractal. No individual cells -the structure
                                        repeats all the way down. Cooper
                                        looks at the sample, then continues scanning the jungle around them,
                                        nervous.<br>E: CONT'D shows him the
                                        sample<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Any sign of big life-forms?<br>C: BRAND<br>D: The
                                        soil's been disturbed. So
                                        something's been moving. But I haven't seen anything. Cooper... are you nervous?
                                        Cooper stops scanning the
                                        trees, embarrassed.<br>E: notices his look<br>C: COOPER<br>D: I just think we
                                        should get back to the shelter
                                        before night falls. Overhead, the light from the ice above begins to fade -- the
                                        neutron star must have
                                        orbited out of view. Night is falling.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: Relax. If there are any
                                        large organisms here, even
                                        predatory ones, they're not going to attack us -they have no idea what we
                                        are.<br>E: laughing<br>C:
                                        COOPER<br>D: You don't know that. You just have blind faith this place is going
                                        to be some kind of Eden.
                                        Brand stops.<br>N: He's struck a nerve.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: Faith has nothing to
                                        do with it. You know what you
                                        are, Cooper? You're just another in a long line of people saying 'no.' That this
                                        isn't going to work. And
                                        frankly, I don't have to convince you.<br>E: truly pissed off<br>C: COOPER<br>D:
                                        What's that supposed to
                                        mean?<br>C: BRAND<br>D: You're on this mission because you're another pair of
                                        hands. You want the truth? I
                                        told Case we should bring another robot over you. At least then I could just

                                        hand away and steps back. Even for her, this is too much. She turns back to
                                        Cooper, who is looking at the
                                        jungle around them, spooked.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: You know how plants don't
                                        usually move? Is that a universal
                                        rule? No.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: There really aren't any rules.<br>N: All around
                                        them, the life-forms begins to
                                        melt toward the ground, breaking down into different, smaller forms.<br>C:
                                        BRAND<br>D: Remember, we're the
                                        aliens. Cooper steps back as several pieces of the nearest tree drop onto the
                                        ground and begin scuttling
                                        toward him.<br>E: CONT'D trying to stay calm<br>C: BRAND<br>D: Hold very still.

                                        movements. Two of the pieces join together, stacking themselves up and
                                        staggering toward him.<br>E:
                                        CONT'D<br>C: COOPER<br>D: The creature lurches toward him on three legs, then
                                        its head splits open and it
                                        BELLOWS. OK.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Now we run.<br>E: CONT'D<br>N: Brand doesn't
                                        argue. They turn and sprint

                                    <p id=85>Scene 85: EXT. JUNGLE -- NIGHT<br>N: Cooper and Brand smash headlong
                                        through the jungle. At first,
                                        they're running from the rumbling, smashing melee behind them. But as they run,

                                        them begins to break apart and move. After a moment, they're surrounded. The
                                        jungle is completely
                                        disassembling itself into a million different pieces, each one a different size

                                        rushes over it in a torrent.
                                        Cooper catches himself at the last minute, grabbing a thick tree branch with one
                                        hand and, a second later,
                                        Brand with the other as she slides past.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: I've got you.

                                        front of the cave fill up with creatures of all sizes, as they tumble down the
                                        hill in what appears to be a
                                        battle royal. For a moment, it looks like Brand and Cooper may go unnoticed.
                                        Then, a three-foot-tall
                                        creature with a dozen legs creeps its way toward the entrance to the cave.

                                        but still thinking, takes the rock from his hand and drops it back to the

                                        game theory. The best move is always to cooperate at first.<br>C: COOPER<br>D:
                                        By "cooperate" do you mean
                                        let it eat me?<br>C: BRAND<br>D: These organisms have no interest in us. They
                                        survive by photosynthesis. All
                                        they need is light.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Then why are they killing each
                                        other?<br>C: BRAND I don't know.<br>D:
                                        But we're outnumbered, Cooper. So unless you have a better idea, I suggest we

                                        BRAND<br>D: It's a colony
                                        organism. It's trying to incorporate you into its structure.<br>C: COOPER<br>D:
                                        I don't want it to
                                        incorporate me.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: Don't open your mouth. Why n-<br>C:
                                        COOPER<br>D: As he speaks, the
                                        creature on his chest extends four spindly, pointed feelers and reaches gently
                                        into his mouth. Cooper holds
                                        his breath as the organism taps against his teeth. Its skin has a roughened
                                        texture, as if incomplete, and
                                        it appears to be searching for the same texture on Cooper's skin, without much
                                        luck. Bored, the life-forms
                                        climb back down off of Cooper. The last two creatures link up in an imitation of
                                        Cooper's lower body and
                                        attempt to walk across the room like a human. After a moment, the creatures
                                        tumble to the ground and flail
                                        away. Cooper is still breathing hard as the cave empties and he and Brand are
                                        left alone again. Brand steps
                                        to the edge of the cave and watches, fascinated, as the creatures resume
                                        wrestling and battling each
                                        other.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: They're killing each other.<br>E: CONT'D<br>C:
                                        BRAND<br>D: No. They don't bleed...
                                        they don't die... they're just competing... trying out different shapes, looking
                                        for the best one.<br>C:
                                        COOPER<br>D: I'd say they have a long way to go.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: They do this
                                        every night. As they watch,
                                        a two-foot-long creature with one huge claw scuttles along the ground, grabbing
                                        smaller opponents and
                                        smashing them apart, then sorting through the wreckage and adopting some of the
                                        writhing parts as its own.
                                        Something about the movement is endearing, the way it experiments with each
                                        piece -- less like a massacre
                                        and more like an over-caffeinated self-assembling erector set. Suddenly, a
                                        massive, lumbering creature
                                        SMASHES down in front of the claw beast. No match, the smaller creature turns to
                                        scuttle away. Too slow. The
                                        larger organism brings one club-like limb smashing down on top of it. After a
                                        moment, it lifts its claw --
                                        the two animals have become one. The new organism lumbers away through the
                                        jungle, happily snapping its new
                                        claw at larger opponents.<br>E: amazed<br>C: BRAND<br>D: The behavior changes as
                                        the animals get bigger and
                                        bigger. More sophisticated. More calculated. Two of the larger organisms square
                                        off, circling each other,
                                        lights pulsing up and down their bodies in a fierce display.<br>E: CONT'D<br>C:

                                        Brand and Cooper huddle around a small chemical fire they've brought with them.
                                        Brand looks at the sample of
                                        the fractal wildlife in her case. It's moving around, splitting apart,
                                        reforming, trying to find a way
                                        out.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: These creatures are billions of years older than we are.
                                        But they're relatively
                                        primitive. They haven't developed tools, culture, language. Why not?<br>C:
                                        COOPER BRAND<br>D: I don't know.
                                        No one knows how intelligent life began on Earth. But the surface of this planet
                                        has virtually no craters.
                                        No impacts. It's been sheltered by the local black holes.<br>C: COOPER<br>D:

                                        make?<br>C: BRAND<br>D: Maybe not enough has gone wrong here. Maybe bad luck is
                                        the key to intelligent
                                        life.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Murph's Law.<br>E: quietly<br>C: BRAND<br>D: Exactly.

                                        them will push them over the top. Maybe that's part of the plan.<br>C:

                                        might be trying to help us?
                                        Cooper is silent for a moment.<br>N: His mood darkens.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: I was
                                        in Denver during the first
                                        year of the famine. I was just a kid. We kept waiting for someone to come help
                                        us. People starved to death
                                        sitting on the ground, waiting for someone to come.<br>E: MORE<br>C:
                                        COOPER<br>D: I only made it because I
                                        realized that nobody was coming to save us. We were on our own. Cooper looks
                                        away.<br>E: CONT'D looks at

                                        After the things I saw... you
                                        want to know why I don't believe that someone would be trying to help us?
                                        Because I'm not sure we're worth
                                        saving. They sit in silence for a while. EXT. CAVE -- NIGHT Cooper sleeps. the

                                        breath -- the temperature is
                                        well below freezing. The first flickers of light are visible in the ice above.
                                        The creatures are huge now,
                                        forty or fifty feet tall, battling each other more and more slowly. As Brand
                                        watches, the largest of them
                                        beats down his rivals, climbing to the top of the heap. Just as the beast
                                        reaches the top, it freezes, as if
                                        stuck. Above, the ice begins to shine brighter and brighter. Suddenly, the beast
                                        on top breaks apart,
                                        unfurling into planes to catch the light. This is what the contest has been
                                        about -a better place in the
                                        sun. Brand takes it in.<br><br></p>

                                        CHINESE COLONY -- DAY Cooper and the others carefully make their way through a
                                        lab that has been completely
                                        emptied -- no desks, no chairs, nothing. The only thing that remains is a solid
                                        ball of matter in the center
                                        of the room.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: What happened here? Roth stares at the ball,
                                        intrigued.<br>C: ROTH<br>D: They
                                        were testing something. Cooper looks at the walls, which are bowed
                                        inwards.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Testing what?
                                        Roth is looking at the ball, which appears to have been built from layers of
                                        different material. The
                                        outermost layer is flattened steel.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Is that a chair? Roth
                                        looks. The outermost layer of
                                        the ball indeed looks like a steel chair, flattened with incredible force onto
                                        surface of the ball. Brand
                                        opens the door to the next lab.<br>E: CONT'D looking closer<br><br></p>

                                        except for a large metal
                                        sphere on a pedestal in the center of the room. A black box is set into a cavity
                                        in the sphere, wired to a
                                        control panel. Cooper looks at the walls of the room, which have been bowed
                                        inwards, as if some great force
                                        had been pulling from the center of the room.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Everything in
                                        here is bolted down. What do

                                        panel. Wipes off an inch of dust and begins tinkering with the controls.<br>E:

                                        wouldn't turn it on until we can figure out what it does, Roth. Roth continues
                                        to look over the controls,
                                        oblivious. Cooper.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: Come look at this.<br>E: O.S.<br>N: Brand

                                        huge space filled with a
                                        near perfect holographic representation of the local system. Cooper joins Brand
                                        and Doyle in the map,
                                        looking at the incredibly detailed models of each star. Case is standing at a
                                        terminal, hacking into the

                                        terminal comes to life. Cooper hands Case his rifle.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: That
                                        should open up most of it. Case
                                        is silent for a beat, parsing the information.<br>E: CONT'D<br>C: CASE<br>D:

                                        They built the colony and
                                        radioed home. But they didn't receive a response.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: No one was

                                        left again and never

                                        their mission plan. There's nothing else.<br>C: DOYLE<br>D: I think I know what
                                        the problem is. Doyle is
                                        manipulating the time component of the map, slowing down the passage of time,
                                        reversing it, speeding it up.
                                        Look.<br>C: DOYLE<br>D: Doyle speeds up the map until the ice planet is nearly a
                                        blur, speeding in its orbit
                                        around Pantagruel.<br>E: CONT'D<br>C: DOYLE<br>D: There's a small black hole
                                        moving into the system. Too
                                        small for us to have seen in our survey. It's not going to hit the planet, but
                                        it's going to come close. A
                                        tiny black hole soars through the system. Although it misses the ice planet, it
                                        deflects its orbit by a tiny
                                        degree. After a dozen more orbits, the ice planet dips down close to
                                        Pantagruel's event horizon and is torn
                                        apart. Brand and the others watch as the sequence rewinds and repeats -the
                                        planet is pieced back together
                                        again and ejected, then pulled back in and torn apart. Over and over.<br>E:

                                        sequence in stunned

                                        plan. Cooper looks at Brand.
                                        She is in disbelief, staring as a lifetime's training and optimism are torn to
                                        pieces.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: But
                                        I don't understand... why are we here? What are we here for? Cooper looks
                                        down.<br>N: Brand's upset is
                                        turning to anger.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: What the hell are we here for? I trained my
                                        whole life to reach this
                                        place. She looks at Cooper, questioning.<br>E: CONT'D<br>C: COOPER<br>D:

                                        maybe we just don't understand it yet. She looks down. She knows he doesn't
                                        believe what he's saying. He's
                                        been right all along -- they're alone. For a tiny moment, all hope is lost.
                                        Suddenly, with a distant RUMBLE,

                                        grows more intense, as if the

                                        is happening to them -- his
                                        boots no longer have traction with the ground. After a second everything in the
                                        room is floating an inch off
                                        of the ground.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Quick -- hold onto something. He reaches out
                                        to Brand but it's too late --
                                        suddenly they're no longer floating, they're falling. They're falling up.<br>E:

                                        control equipment for the
                                        holographic display, which is GROANING under a load it was never built to

                                        up and sideways through the
                                        stairwell, like an Escher painting. Brand pushes Cooper out of the way as debris
                                        from the control panel
                                        orbits past them back up towards the lab. They try to hang on but the force is
                                        becoming irresistible,
                                        dragging them along the wall of the stairwell and back towards the lab upstairs.
                                        Brand wedges herself
                                        against the railing as objects and debris are SMASHING against the door to the

                                        onto the handrail but his grip slips and he CRIES OUT as he falls towards the
                                        door to the lab, SMASHING it
                                        open. Doyle disappears up and into the lab. Cooper slips trying to help Doyle.

                                        bearings: Roth, Doyle, and
                                        everything that hasn't been bolted down is either pressed against the sphere in
                                        the center of the room or is
                                        orbiting around it. Roth, who is laughing, jubilant, shouts up to him:<br>C:
                                        ROTH<br>D: The control panel is
                                        beneath you. See if you can turn it off.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: I found it. Hold
                                        onto something. Roth and Doyle
                                        crawl up the side of the mass and hold onto the support wires. Cooper hits a key
                                        on the monitor. Suddenly,
                                        the room inverts again, reverting to a normal gravitational field. Cooper floats
                                        for a second, then topples
                                        back to the ground, along with everything else. Brand stumbles in to find Cooper
                                        sprawled on the floor as
                                        Roth and Doyle hang onto the sphere for dear life. INT. INTACT LAB, CHINESE
                                        COLONY -- NIGHT Roth, back on
                                        terra firma, is looking at the tiny black box he's pried from the center of the
                                        sphere. Cooper is looking
                                        over his shoulder.<br>E: yells up<br>C: COOPER<br>D: They found a way to make
                                        gravity.<br>C: ROTH<br>D: Not
                                        make it. Adjust it. Dial it up, or down. I think they were experimenting with it
                                        -- firing these into the
                                        black hole to try to save this planet.<br>C: DOYLE<br>D: All that from one tiny
                                        box. Roth has hooked the box
                                        up to a terminal and it scrolling through the incredibly sophisticated machine
                                        code, trying to parse how it
                                        works. Cooper looks on.<br>C: ROTH<br>D: It barely uses any power. I'm only
                                        beginning to understand what it
                                        does but I think it sends a signal out into the bulk. It must tap into the same
                                        technologies that were used
                                        to create the wormholes in the first place.<br>E: amazed<br>C: COOPER<br>D: What
                                        does that mean?<br>C:
                                        ROTH<br>D: It means whoever built the wormhole probably doesn't exist inside our
                                        universe. Cooper looks at
                                        the tiny box.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: But how did the Chinese develop the technology?
                                        This would take decades,
                                        maybe hundreds of years, to create.<br>C: CASE<br>D: Wherever they went, they
                                        found something that allowed
                                        them to build it. Brand looks at the box.<br>C: ROTH<br>D: They came back here
                                        and tried to use these
                                        devices to save this planet. But they didn't work. Nothing would be strong
                                        enough to weaken a black
                                        hole.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: Maybe we could work with it. improve it.<br>N: Try
                                        to<br>C: ROTH<br>D: No. You're
                                        missing the bigger picture. The robots had strict mission parameters. They were
                                        told to build a colony and
                                        report back. They tried to. But they failed. Like us they were fixated on this
                                        place. Cooper looks at
                                        Brand.<br>C: ROTH<br>D: They didn't realize they had already found something
                                        that would save us all. This.
                                        This is the prize. He holds up the box.<br>E: CONT'D holds up the box<br>C:
                                        ROTH<br>D: Don't you see?
                                        Earth's gravity is like a prison. But this is like a master key.<br>E: CONT'D
                                        MORE<br>C: ROTH<br>D: If we
                                        could build more of these, we could turn down the earth's gravitational field
                                        enough to save millions of
                                        people. We wouldn't have to pick a handful of people to survive. With this we
                                        can save everyone.<br>E:
                                        CONT'D<br>C: BRAND<br>D: And go where?<br>C: ROTH<br>D: Wherever we want. We
                                        don't belong in any one place.
                                        Can't you see that now? Not Earth. Not this place. Nowhere. If the human race is
                                        going to survive, we need
                                        to keep moving. Split up. Spread out. Fly. With this, we can. Case looks at the
                                        box.<br>N: Makes a
                                        decision.<br>C: CASE<br>D: In the morning we're taking this and going home.
                                        Doyle, Roth and Case set about
                                        making preparations to leave -gathering space suits, equipment. In the bustle,
                                        Cooper finds Brand sitting
                                        alone, staring at the sample of fractal life.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: I know this
                                        isn't exactly what you trained
                                        for. But I think Roth might be right.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: That doesn't help this
                                        planet. This creature is
                                        doomed. Unlike us it doesn't have anywhere to go. The fractal organism almost
                                        seems to be looking at her,
                                        trying to comprehend. But it quickly loses interest and goes back to breaking
                                        itself into pieces and
                                        reforming into different shapes, trying to escape. Brand sets it back down. CUT

                                        She hefts the case and they

                                        rocket out from the shelter. Assembly is semiautomatic -- Cooper lifts the
                                        pieces up and they snap together,
                                        forming a crude two-stage rocket designed more for a robot than a man. When it's

                                        Cooper into the lab. Cooper
                                        opens the storage crate. Picks one of the probes at random. Sets it down on the
                                        bench next to Roth. Cooper
                                        begins rigging up a connection between the two.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: I'm going to
                                        image the operating code and
                                        the architecture onto the probe's hard drive. It'll be garbled, but it should
                                        give you and me enough to
                                        rebuild it when we get back. Cooper looks at the probe filling up with data. Not

                                        you'll make it work.<br>N: The transfer is complete. Roth hands Cooper the
                                        probe, and takes the black box
                                        himself.<br>C: ROTH<br>D: This is a one-way trip for me. Before Cooper can
                                        respond, Roth heads for the door.
                                        EXT. CHINESE BASE CAMP, ICE PLANET -- NIGHT Roth squeezes himself into the

                                        right, Roth. We can find a
                                        way for all of us to leave.<br>C: ROTH<br>D: This is the only way. Keep the

                                        have to keep exploring. Keep learning. One good idea isn't enough. You'll need
                                        more and more of them just to
                                        survive. Do you understand? Thank you. Go.<br>E: CONT'D nods<br>N: BRAND<br>C:

                                        EXT. LANDER -- NIGHT Cooper checks over the hull, which is intact. Doyle is
                                        inside looking over the

                                        Brand is looking off into the distance.<br>C: BRAND<br>D: Someone's coming.
                                        Cooper looks up. A robotlike
                                        figure is limping through the snowstorm towards them. Cooper raises the rifle.
                                        Finally he makes out the
                                        insignia -- it's Case. Cooper and Doyle run out towards him. They reach Case as
                                        he collapses in the snow.
                                        He's badly injured -- one leg torn off at the knee, one arm mangled. Doyle and
                                        Cooper drag the crippled
                                        robot back into the ship. INT. LANDER -- NIGHT They drag Case into the lander.

                                        wrong.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Where's Brand? She's nowhere to be seen. Cooper looks
                                        out onto the ice. Brand is
                                        heading back out into the snow.<br>C: COOPER<br>D: Dammit. If I don't make it

                                        that thing home. Cooper steps to the door. EXT. SPACE ABOVE ICE PLANET The
                                        rocket tucks in close behind one
                                        of the moons orbiting the ice planet. The rocket fires to maneuver closer and
                                        closer to the moon's surface
                                        -- the tiny moon doesn't provide enough gravity to attract it. When the rocket
                                        is close enough, Roth
                                        detonates the explosive bolts holding him inside and leaps for the moon's
                                        surface. He scrambles to grab hold
                                        of the craggy surface. Behind him, the rocket smashes apart against the surface.
                                        Roth finally gets a good
                                        hold.<br>E: CONT'D points to probe<br>N: He looks down. Below him, the view is

                                        curving into the distance, Gargantua rising over its horizon. Roth looks at the
                                        black box in his

                                        time Cooper catches up with her. She is digging in the snow. He takes her arm
                                        but she won't go. She finally
                                        finds what she's looking for -- the sample case. The tiny fractal life-form is
                                        huddled at the bottom. Cooper
                                        shakes his head and turns back to the lander. 109.*<br><br></p>

                                        planet pass by beneath him.
                                        He finally sees the distant peaks of the mountain range as it punctures the ice
                                        near the Chinese camp. For a
                                        moment he enjoys the view -- the distant hulk of Gargantua rising over the
                                        horizon of the shining ice

                                        a point in the middle of the cabin. Doyle points a finger gently at the sphere,
                                        which grows in response.
                                        Brand pulls herself into the cabin. Several more points appear, as if they've
                                        been summoned by the first.
                                        Some of the points twist, some of them spin, and some of them are

                                        all. I think it lives in the bulk -- the space that the wormholes traverse. And
                                        it can only interact with us
                                        using gravity. The shape playfully grows around Cooper's hand, bending the space
                                        it's in, stretching the
                                        skin. Doyle GASPS as the sphere nearest him moves through his body, coming to
                                        rest in the middle and bending
                                        his entire torso like a fun house mirror. Suddenly, the sphere wrapped around
                                        Cooper's hand begins moving,
                                        tugging him gently through the cabin. In the next moment, all three of them are
                                        being propelled through the
                                        cabin. It's a magical moment -- a communion, a dance between creatures on either
                                        side of a massive,
                                        invisible wall. Doyle exclaims like a kid on a roller coaster as he is whirled
                                        around the room.<br>C:
                                        COOPER<br>D: Can we communicate with them?<br>C: BRAND<br>D: Where would we even
                                        start?<br>N: Maybe-- She
                                        pull a bag of ball bearings out of a storage bin and tears the bag open,
                                        releasing a cloud of the tiny
                                        shining globes into the air. For a moment, nothing happens. Then, the
                                        distortions begin moving through the
                                        bearings, shifting them, rearranging them into patterns in the air. First, they
                                        rearrange the ball bearings
                                        into clusters, then shapes spinning around each other -- planets orbiting around
                                        a medium-sized star.<br>C:
                                        DOYLE<br>D: That's our solar system. After a moment the ball bearings break
                                        apart again and rearrange into a
                                        larger, more complicated system -- Gargantua, Pantagruel, and the ice planet.
                                        Finally, the bearings compress
                                        to a two-dimensional sheet. Inside the sheet, one solitary ball bearing orbits
                                        around the stars and then
                                        pushes up, off of the sheet, into an umbrella shaped space that rises up from
                                        the sheet.<br>C: COOPER<br>D:

                                        close in on something in the darkness: a tiny point of light. As they grow
                                        closer, they realize that it's an
                                        opening. They are inside a massive, hollow sphere. They have been the entire
                                        time. The ship is guided out
                                        through the opening at the crown of the sphere. Below them is an astonishing
                                        sight: Our entire universe,
                                        compressed into a flattened disc, like a floor of stars. They are hovering above

                                        between universes. INT. ENDURANCE, BULK Brand and the others stare at the
                                        incredible display. The ship drops
                                        down and begins to orbit around the massive hollow sphere between them and our

                                        until it is skimming just above the surface of the sphere. In the distance, they
                                        can make out a cluster of

                                        one wall, mapping some of
                                        the wormholes.<br>C: TARS<br>D: There are millions of them, connecting virtually
                                        every planetary system in
                                        the universe. There are thousands in our galaxy alone. But the Chinese stopped
                                        mapping them when they found
                                        what they were looking for. Tars walks further.<br>N: He stops. The platform in
                                        front of them is dominated
                                        by a gigantic version of the black box that Roth found on the ice planet,
                                        connected to a massive power
                                        array, and pointing into the dark space above the sphere. 133.*<br>C: TARS<br>D:

                                        creation. They had to capture the mini black hole just to have enough power to
                                        try it. Several miles above
                                        the black box, one of the wormholes glows far brighter than the others,
                                        crackling with radiation.<br>E:

                                        They weren't interested in the
                                        other wormholes because their mission was to return home. That one leads back to
                                        Earth. The Earth they were
                                        told to return to. Tars walks to the controls for the device.<br>C: BRAND<br>D:

                                        looks calm enough right here. Cooper starts to walk.<br><br></p>

                                        of his kitchen. Two walls are
                                        missing and the rest is collapsed in a heap. But he can still see where he used
                                        to feed his kids breakfast.
                                        He has kept his promise. Several hundred years too late. Cooper hunkers down,
                                        staring at the space where his
                                        kids used to be. Rainwater covers the ancient formica. It has taken him years to
                                        finally reach this place.
                                        He has had plenty of time to come to grips with what he might find. But nothing
                                        has prepared him for this:
                                        He is completely alone. Nothing is left.<br><br></p>

                                        there when the ice storm
                                        hits. Unchecked by trees or vegetation, the wind rockets through the house,
                                        blasting Cooper and pelting
                                        what's left of the structure with fist-sized hail. Cooper takes shelter against
                                        the remaining wall. He's
                                        going to have to sit this one out -- the hail and winds are the brutal
                                        descendants of the weather he knew.
                                        They'll finish him off if he steps back outside. As he watches, the pool of

                                        freezes over in seconds.<br><br></p>

                                        against the wall. The storm
                                        is still raging outside. He is freezing to death. He has to move now or he will
                                        die. He pulls the hood tight
                                        around his face and stumbles outside.<br><br></p>

                                        to find his way, but the ship has been consumed by the blizzard. He stumbles to
                                        the ground, dropping the
                                        glass case with the fractal wildlife in it. The case shatters. Cooper tries to
                                        stand back up, but his

                                        tentatively out of its broken
                                        habitat. It forms together against the cold. After a moment, it burrows into the
                                        ice. As it does, the ice
                                        glows faintly. It seems to be right at home. Cooper laughs, glimpsing the
                                        outline of a plan. Was this what
                                        the beings who made the wormhole intended all along? Cooper suddenly spots the
                                        outline of the ship through
                                        the driving snow. He stumbles back up to his feet and struggles a few more
                                        steps, then stumbles again,
                                        spent. Finally, he sits down in the snow to die. As his senses flicker in and
                                        out, he is struck with
                                        memories of his boys, so vivid he reaches out for them, crawling forward in the
                                        snow. He stops, and laughs,
                                        remembering what Case told him about what happens when humans die. He struggles
                                        to his feet and stumbles a
                                        few more feet, eventually coming to rest just steps from the ship. Cooper takes
                                        a final step. Finally, he
                                        collapses under his ship, as the wind continues to HOWL around him. As the snow
                                        clears for a moment, Cooper
                                        is alone on a vast arctic tundra. He will die alone.<br>C: BLACK<br>D: FADE IN:

                                        open window. Cooper sits up. As he a does, a control panel on the wall TONES
                                        gently, as if in response to
                                        his movement. He stands and looks around. He can see sunlight through the open

                                        kids YELLING as they play. He moves toward the window. Reaches for the curtains.

                                        to take it easy? I hope you
                                        understand, we all you hold you in the highest possible regard. Which is why

                                        going to be a farmer again.
                                        After a moment, the tractor stops. Cooper climbs down from the seat. Looks at
                                        the front steering linkage,
                                        which is jammed with an errant tree branch. He wipes his forehead and begins
                                        working the branch out of the
                                        machine. He looks miserable. A robot, a similar unit to Tars, walks over. a

                                        familiar crack of the bat as an intramural team from the university practices.
                                        Cooper watches. He looks
                                        bored. The kid up to bat cracks a pop fly. For a second, the catcher shuffles
                                        back and forth, trying to get
                                        himself into position. But the ball never returns. The catcher YELLS out a
                                        warning. Above, the ball begins
                                        to slowly fall up, not down, toward the town center above. After a second, the
                                        ball smashes through a
                                        skylight of a building high above them. Cooper watches as the kid rounds the

                                        look. It's Cooper and his robot pal. The robot is wearing a baseball cap and
                                        carrying a toolbox. Cooper
                                        gestures to the robot, who sets down the toolbox with a click against the
                                        mirror-like floor. Cooper shakes
                                        his head, annoyed, at the robot, and puts his finger to his lips. The robot
                                        nods, bashful. Cooper waves a
                                        small handheld computer near the skin of the ship until it lights up. Then he
                                        punches in a few codes.
                                        Nothing happens. He punches in a few more. Suddenly, the hatch opens with a

                                        <p>A lot has been said and written about Interstellar. You can obviously take
                                            apart any movie that is out
                                            there. You'll either love this one or you won't. I kind of would have loved
                                            to have watched this on an
                                            IMAX
                                            screen, the sheer scope of the whole thing. It's just amazing, what Nolan
                                            has put on screen here. It's
                                            not
                                            only the visual experience (there is no 3D here by the way), it's the
                                            story/ride you take with it. It
                                            might
                                            be clear to some earlier than to others, where it's heading (no pun
                                            intended), but it doesn't change the
                                            fact that it's beautiful ... and terrifying at the same time.</p>
                                        <p>
                                            Going out and saying this will be considered a classic, might not be too far
                                            stretched, but you still
                                            can never predict those things. The deserved love the movie gets on IMDb and
                                            other places would be an
                                            indicator that this will ring true though. The acting is really good, but I
                                            can understand if some
                                            people have issues with the ending. But the movie had to end in one way or
                                            another. It's the best
                                            possible way this could go, even if it's not in our grasps just yet ...
